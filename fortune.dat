another sign below it that said 'self service'. So I hired
myself. Then I made myself the boss. I gave myself a raise. I
paid myself. Then I quit.

A cop stopped me for speeding.  He said, 'Why were you going so
fast?' I said, 'See this thing my foot is on? It's called an
accelerator. When you push down on it, it sends more gas to the
engine. The whole car just takes right off. And see this thing?
This steers it'

If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting 
them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.
###      
To me, it's a good idea to always carry two sacks of something 
when you walk around. That way, if anybody says, "Hey, can you give me a
hand?" You can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."
###      
One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going 
to take myn ephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old burned-
out warehouse. "Oh no," I said, "Disneyland burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a pretty good joke.

       If you lived in the Dark Ages and you were a catapult operator, 
     I
       bet
       the
       most common question people would ask is, "Can't you make it 
     shoot
       farther?" "No, I'm sorry. That's as far as it shoots."
###       
       Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful
       flamingo,
       flying
       across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he's carrying a 
     beautiful
       rose in
       his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful painting with 
     his
       feet. And
       also, you're drunk.
###      
       I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our
       children's
       children, because I don't think children should be having sex.
###       
       If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to 
     tell
       him
       is, "God
       is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing
      
     to
       tell
       him
       is, "Probably because of something you did."
###       
       If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the
       mirror,
       because I
       bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.
###       
       Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my 
     first
       instinct
       is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant and she fell
      
     on
       me.
       Then it
       wouldn't seem quite so funny.
###       
       
       To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no
       choreography
       and the dancers hit each other.
###       
     
       I hope if dogs ever take over the world and they choose a king, 
     they
       don't
       just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with 
     some
       good
       ideas.

       If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the 
     lemons

       by
       shoving them down his throat).
###
       
       Instead of having "answers" on a math test, they should just 
     call
       them
       "impressions," and if you got a different "impression," so what,
       can't
       we all
       be brothers?
###      
       Probably the earliest fly swatters were nothing more than some

       I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed 
     out
       that
       I'd
       just quit my job and become a bum for a few years, because I was
       thinking
       about doing that anyway.
###      
       I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate 
     revolver.
       And
       since he's so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him real 
     quick
       and
       hand it to him.
###       
       Maybe in order to understand mankind we have to look at that 
     word
       itself.
       MANKIND. Basically, it's made up of two separate words "mank" 
     and
       "ind." What do these words mean? It's a mystery and that's why 
     so 
     is
       mankind.
###       
       If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else 
     flying
       forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye 
     contact.
###       
       It's easy to sit there and say you'd like to have more money. 
     And 
     I
       guess
       that's what I like about it. It's easy. Just sitting there, 
     rocking
       back
       and
       forth, wanting that money.
###       
       If you ever reach total enlightenment while you're drinking a 
     beer,
       I
       bet it
       makes beer shoot out your nose.
###       
       To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kinda scary. I've
       wondered
       where this started and I think it goes back to the time I wen to
      
     the
       circus
       and a clown killed my dad.
###       
       As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red
       again I
       sat there thinking about life. Was it nothing more than a bunch 
     of
       honking
       and yelling? Sometimes it seemed that way.
###       
       I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without 
     hate.
       And
       I
       can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect
      
     it.
###      
       I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its 
     eggs
       in my
       brain, because later you might think you're having a good idea 
     but
       it's
       just
       eggs hatching.
###       
       Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right 
     there,
       in
       the
       room talking to you, which is why I don't like to read good 
     books.
###       
       What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds 
     singing
       and
       the
       wind rustling through the leaves, that makes you want to get 
     drunk?
       And
       after you're real drunk, maybe go down to the public park and
       stagger
       around and ask people for money, and then lay down and go to 
     sleep.
###      
       Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks 
     out
       it,
       and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like
      a
       regular
       window.
###       
       During the Middle Ages, probably one of the biggest mistakes was
      
     not
       putting on your armor because you were "just going down to the
       corner.
###       
       If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor 
     people,
       like I
       am
       now.
###      
       When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was 
     call
       the
       police.
       But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and started
       wondering
       who
       this person was, and why he had deer horns.
###       
       I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and
       whittle
       all
       day long. Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a larger toy 
     boat 
     I
       had.
       It
       was almost as good as the first one, except now it had bumpy 
     whittle
       marks
       all over it. And no paint, because he had whittled off the 
     paint.
###       
       Here's a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don't 
     know
       anybody:
       First take out the garbage. Then go around and collect any extra
       garbage
       that people might have, like a crumpled napkin, and take that 
     out
       too.
       Pretty soon people will want to meet the busy garbage guy.
###
       Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand your 
     rights,
       even
       if you don't know what your rights are, or who the person is 
     you're
       talking
       to. Then on the way out, slam the door.
###     
       If you're a cowboy and you're dragging a guy behind your horse, 
     I
       bet it
       would really make you mad if you looked back and the guy was 
     reading
       a
       magazine.
###      
       If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, I 
     think
       it's okay
       to feed some bits of your friend to one of the vultures, to 
     teach
       him to
       do
       some tricks. But only if you're serious about adoptin the 
     vulture.
###      
       Broken promises don't upset me. I just think, why did they 
     believe
       me?
###       
       If you ever crawl inside an old hollow log and go to sleep, and
       while
       you're
       in there some guys come and seal up both ends and then put it o 
     a
       truck
       and take it to another city, boy, I don't know what to tell you.
###       
       One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is, don't 
     run
       with
       a
       wooden stake.
###      
       If you go to a costume party at your boss's house, wouldn't you
       think a
       good costume would be to dress up like the boss's wife? Trust 
     me,
       it's
       not.
###       
       Most of the time it was probably real bad being stuck down in a
       dungeon.
       But some days, when there was a bad storm outside, you'd loo out
       your
       little window and think, "Boy, I'm glad I'm not out in that."
###      
       Consider the daffodil. And while you're doing that, I'll be over
       here
       looking
       through your stuff.
###       
       For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here's a tip: why 
     not
       add a
       slice
       of lemon to each jar, for freshness?
###       
       I'd like to see a nature film where an eagle swoops down and 
     pulls 
     a
       fish
       out of a lake, and then maybe he's flying along, low to the 
     ground,
       and
       the
       fish pulls a worm out of the ground. Now that's a documentary.
###     
       If I was the head of a country that lost a war, and I had to 
     sign 
     a
       peace
       treaty, just as I was signing, I'd glance over the treaty and 
     then
       suddenly
       act surprised. "Wait a minute! I thought we won!"
###       
       Sometimes you have to be careful when selecting a new name for
       yourself.
       For instance, let's say you have chosen the nickname "Fly Head."
       Normally you would think that "fly Head" would mean a person who
      
     has
       beautiful swept-back features, as if flying through the air. But
       think
       again.
       Couldn't it also mean "having a head like a fly"? I'm afraid 
     some
       people
       might actually think that.
###     
       Somebody told me how frightening it was how much topsoil we are
       losing
       each year, but I told that story around the campfire and nobody 
     got
       scared.
###       
       I hope that after I die, people will say of me: "That guy sure 
     owed
       me a
       lot
       of money."
###      
       I wish I had a dollar for every time I spent a dollar, because 
     then,
       Yahoo!,
       I'd have all my money back.
###      
       I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat." It's a fake 
     baby
       duck,
       which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming 
     underwater
       until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you join them. 
     Then
       all
       of
       the sudden, you stand up out of the water and roar like 
     Godzilla.
       Man
       those ducks really take off! Also Baby Duck Hat i good for 
     parties.
###
       
       If you get invited to your first orgy, don't just show up nude.
       That's a
       common mistake. You have to let nudity "happen."
###
Did you know, that if you eat as much ketchup as there is in an apple (which is none), that has
               the same nutritional value as eating the apple itself? The conclusion is that we don't need to eat
               anything at all, as long as what we're not eating is ketchup. 
###
I think that if cloning ever becomes a viable thing, that Serial Killers should Not be able to
               clone themselves. Because, you know, like, DNA Testing wouldn't work any more, and we could never
               catch them. 

###

               Hey, I wonder what happens if you patent The Sun or The Moon or the Atlantic Ocean or something.
               Probably nothing, probably they just laugh you out of the patent office. 
###

How stupidly egocentric are we that we name our sun 'Sun'? That's like people who name their pet
               dog 'Dog'. Say aliens come visit us, and they're like, "What do you call your sun? Ours is called
               Zoloquon B-12." And we have to admit reluctantly, "Uh... we call it 'sun'." 

###
Every great scientific truth goes through three
                                           stages: 
                                           First, people say it conflicts with the Bible. 
                                           Next they say it had been discovered before. 
                                           Lastly, they say they always believed it.
###
My grandmother started walking five miles a day
                                           when she was sixty. She's ninety-seven now, and we
                                           don't know where the hell she is.
###
Curiosity is the very basis of education and if you
                                           tell me that curiosity killed the cat, I say only
                                           the cat died nobly.
###
Once... in the wilds of Afghanistan, I lost my
                                           corkscrew, and we were forced to live on nothing
                                           but food and water for days. 
###

                                           We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients.
                                           But we can't scoff at them personally, to their
                                           faces, and this is what annoys me. 
###
For best results: wash in cold water separately,
                                           hang dry and iron with warm iron. For not so good
                                           results: drag behind car through puddles, blow-dry
                                           on roofrack.
###
Stand firm in your refusal to remain conscious
                                           during algebra. In real life, I assure you, there
                                           is no such thing as algebra. 
###
Very few people possess true artistic ability. It
                                           is therefore both unseemly and unproductive to
                                           irritate the situation by making an effort. If you
                                           have a burning, restless urge to write or paint,
                                           simply eat something sweet and the feeling will
                                           pass. 
###
Illegal aliens have always been a problem in the
                                           United States. Ask any Indian.

"That's right", he said. "We're philosophers. We
                                           think, therefore we am".
###
His philosophy was a mixture of three famous
                                           schools -- the Cynics, the Stoics and the
                                           Epicureans -- and summed up all three of them in
                                           his famous phrase, "You can't trust any bugger
                                           further than you can throw him, and there's nothing
                                           you can do about it, so let's have a drink." 
###
After all, what is your hosts' purpose in having a
                                           party? Surely not for you to enjoy yourself; if
                                           that were their sole purpose, they'd have simply
                                           sent champagne and women over to your place by
                                           taxi.
###
The trouble with her is that she lacks the power of
                                           conversation but not the power of speech. 

###
Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's
                                           not whether you win or lose, but how drunk you get.
###
If a person offends you and you are in doubt as to
                                           whether it was intentional or not, do not resort to
                                           extreme measures. Simply watch your chance and hit
                                           him with a brick.

I want to die peacefully in my sleep like my
                                           grandfather ...

If all mankind were to disappear, the world would
                                           regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium
                                           that existed 10,000 years ago. If insects were to
                                           vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos
